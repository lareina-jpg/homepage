        <h1>On Ursula and Laurel: Or, the Fear of Putting My Phone Away</h1>
        <p>I am addicted to my phone</p>
        <p>Like all addictions, it's not easy to admit. But I am. Addicted, I mean.</p>
        <p>Every time it runs out of battery, when I forget to charge it before going on public transport or fail to bring a power bank, I am secretly relieved.</p>
        <p><i>Now, </i>I think, <i>I'll have to use my brain.</i>
        <p>Not for long, though. As soon as I get home the phone gets charged again. And again, and again, and again.<p>
        <p>How many of my thoughts are made for me?</p>
        <p>How much of my outrage is baseless and farcical?</p>
        <p>Am I just a collection of algorithmnically generated opinions, optimized based on predictions of my age, gender, and social class?</p>
        <p>All of my childhood is stored in a bank on a server, immortalized in chat logs on Instagram.</p>
        <p>I've had the same account since I was thirteen.</p>
        <p>All you'd have to do is scroll up.</p>
        <p>And up, and up, and up.</p>
        <p>Then, you'd find it.</p>
        <p>All of me.</p>
        <p>Every person that I was, and am, and ever will be.</p>
        <p>Online. Forever.</p>
