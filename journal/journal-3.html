    <h1>On The Small Web: Or, My Mind is a House</h1>
    <p>I have a room in a small house.</p>
    <p>I would like to decorate this room with many things, in my own special way.</p>
    <p>With a glowing yellow lamp, soft scarves, thick blankets, and green plants.</p>
    <p>I would like to be the architect of this room's feeling.</p>
    <p>I would like to decide who I meet in this room,</p>
    <p>because I am leery of strangers,</p>
    <p>and very protective of my soft and precious objects.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I would like to show everyone the nice things I've collected,</p>
    <p>and tell them the stories of how I bought this necklace in Florence last summer,</p>
    <p>and how this dreamcatcher above my bed has protected me from nightmares for 15 years,</p>
    <p>and how I have too many books but not enough will to read them,</p>
    <p>and how I stash sweaters in a drawer in my closet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But every time I try,</p>
    <p>Elon Musk barges through my bedroom door</p>
    <p>and starts yelling about Mecha Hitler.</p>
