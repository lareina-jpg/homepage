    <h1>On Becca Abe: Or, I Am Trying to Have Agency</h1>
    <p>I am tired of having things presented to me,</p>
    <p>and being told I must live with them.</p>
    <p>I am tired of algorithms as facts; the inevitability of appeasing superpowers.</p>
    <p>I do not want to run in the rat race,</p>
    <p>or sell my self,</p>
    <p>to buy other things.</p>
    <p>I am tired of the constructed "me."</p>
    <p>I am tired of the constructed "we."</p>
    <p>I am wondering if I can afford to refuse.</p>
    <p>I am scared of what will happen if I leave.</p>
    <p>I am trying to have agency,</p>
    <p>and leave this turtle shell casing,</p>
    <p>for smaller, yet better things.</p>
