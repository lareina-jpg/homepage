    <h1>On J.R. Carpenter: Or, My Computer is Dying</h1>
    <p>I need to get a new case for my computer.</p>
    <p>It is a very old computer.</p>
    <p>2019 MacBook Pro, 16 inches.</p>
    <p>It is extremely heavy and hurts my wrists whenever I type because I rest my arms on the big clunky touchpad and the keys are greasy from my fingers and the display has a weird discolored bar on the left side because I must've banged it on a table or dropped it or did something. I don't know.</p>
    <p>I have had this computer since sophomore year of high school, when I did my very first graphic design project designing a poster for my church Christmas party.</p>
    <p>It cost my parents a couple thousand dollars. By then I'd convinced them that I was going to art school, <em>but don't worry! I'll major in graphic design!</em> So I definitely need this fancy computer with the processing power of a small country.</p>
    <p>It has no external functions except for four (4) usb-c ports. I have to get adapters for sim cards, HDMIs, basically anything of substance.</p>
    <p>I think the 2019 Macbooks were the only ones with the little screen atop the keyboard and four identical ports.</p>
    <p>Apple changed it back a year later once they realized no one wanted four fucking identical ports.</p>
    <p>Oh well.</p>
    <p>Guess I should've waited another year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My computer's been through a lot.</p>
    <p>Like a wizened whore.</p>
    <p>Or a semi-retired racing dog.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I learned how to torrent illegal movies on this computer.</p>
    <p>I learned how to fiddle with the custom desktop theme on my Tumblr page dedicated to Star Wars fanfiction on this computer.</p>
    <p>I learned how to print off free sheet music on this computer.</p>
    <p>I learned everything I know about design and art on this one, clunky, heavy, old and dying computer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yes, it is dying.</p>
    <p>Pages are slower to load.</p>
    <p>I need to quit and refresh things more and more often.</p>
    <p>One day, the stripe on my screen will go from a mildly discolored nuisance to a vomiting, unignorable crash.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But for now, it is mine.</p>
    <p>PDFs. EPUBs. Photos. Files.</p>
    <p>It's all mine.</p>
    <p>Forever.</p>
